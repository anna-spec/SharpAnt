            <h2>Back-End Development</h2>
                <p>Back-end is surely the most important part of any website and software
                    development. It is true that it is hidden and away from user eyes,
                    but it is the very thing that makes the software to work and serves
                    as a foundation for solid user experience. Without back-end, software
                    will not be able to function in the way user expects it to.
                    The back-end and front-end are bind in a way to create the full
                    user experience. Data generated in the back-end is passed to the
                    front-end and then it is presented to the user.
                    </p>
                <p>We provide custom back-end development services for various web,
                    and cloud-based apps across multiple domains. No matter what
                    requirements your business has, our back-end development team
                    will provide you with a customized solution that will help you
                    achieve your business goals.</p>
                    <p>Our core back-end development tech-stack is PHP and its frameworks,
                    and for Data Management we offer MySQL. PHP allows
                    developers to significantly speed up the wireframing stage due to
                    the lesser amount of interdependencies while retaining the same functionality
                    and productivity levels. PHP has many advantages as it provides with Simplicity,
                    Platform diversity, Flexibility, Scalability, High safety and Open-source.
